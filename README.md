 ### ðŸ’«ASTEROID APOCALYPSE ðŸ’«

## What this project is about
Asteroid Apocalypse is a game project built in 4 days during the Codaisseur web development bootcamp. The aim of the assignment was to build a full-stack multiplayer game app from scratch, implementing technology that supports multiple simultaneous games with a lobby system. The goal of our project was to implement a new technology (p5js) for the creation of custom graphics, and data streams.
